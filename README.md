# Skin-Cancer-Detection-TensorFlow-CNN
This project was devolped in Kaggle utilizing the following dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhaveshmittal/melanoma-cancer-dataset
The project was developed using tensorflow.
The training, validation, testing sets contained, about 10000, 1100, 2000 images respectively.
The images were grouped in two classes 'Beningn' and 'Malignant'.
The neural network consisted of 3 convolution layers alternating with three maxpooling layers and two dense layers.
The training accuracy was over 95%, validation accuracy 89%, testing accuracy was about 92%.
